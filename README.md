# Treasure Hunt
This project was created during the 2 days of the Blockathon 2016 by Coinsilium.

The purpose of this blockchain app is to prove that someone has been to a given location, and be rewarded for it.

There is one main contract, and any number of satellite contracts in Ethereum.
The beacon model also puts JSON files in IPFS.
